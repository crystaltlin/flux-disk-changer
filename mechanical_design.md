# Mechanical Design Notes

## Disk unloader
- the tip of the wedge should be placed on FLUX Delta's metal plate
- make sure the tip of the unloader stays flat on the surface to guarantee it to go under the disk
- a thin bridge between the tip of two arms can prevent disk from coming off while the unloader moves


## Disk loader (disk holder + spatula)
- in order to prevent the holder from moving, the metal axis and disk holder should be made altogether
- the starting point of the spatula should be on top of the supporting platform
- the weight of the disk bends the spatula; the whole operation will be more precise and fluent if the spatula is built with stronger material

!!Note: both machines should be secured to FLUX Delta or the table

## Disk
- need wedges on it's side to enable the unloader to go under it
